Disaster, we've heard from Steve Johnson's lawyers.
He claims that Michael Mitchell was hired on the same day as him, but was hired later in the day. Mitchell should have been let go 
not him.
Confirm this by extending the number of results and make sure nobody else was hired on that day.
Then modify the query to return the correct 3 people.
Continue to use HireDate as the primary sort column, but use EmployeeId as the tie breaker.
Assume that a higher EmployeeId means they were hired later.

Expected : 3 rows (starting with the following)
8	Laura	Callahan	2004-03-04 00:00:00
7	Robert	King	2004-01-02 00:00:00
6	Michael	Mitchell	2003-10-17 00:00:00

MY SOLUTION:
select EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate from Employee
    order by EmployeeId desc
    limit 3;
    
expected solution:
SELECT EmployeeId, LastName, FirstName, HireDate FROM Employee
ORDER BY HireDate DESC, EmployeeId DESC
LIMIT 3;
