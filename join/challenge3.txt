Create a Query that shows: The name of a track, the name of it's MediaType, and the name of it's genre. You'll need to join 3 tables together with the appropriate join columns. Add a filter to only show tracks with a MediaType of "Protected AAC audio file" and a Genre of "Soundtrack".




select Track.Name, MediaType.Name, Genre.Name from Track
    INNER JOIN MediaType on Track.MediaTypeId = MediaType.MediaTypeId
    INNER JOIN Genre on Track.GenreId = Genre.GenreId
    where MediaType.Name = "Protected AAC audio file" and Genre.Name = "Soundtrack";
